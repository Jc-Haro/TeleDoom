1.1.0
3D Character Sci-Fi Robots Bundle includes four full rigged humanoid robot characters for many purposes including gamedev and animating. 

Origins of all models and prefabs are set to lower middle point for easy scaling. Models have no sprite textures and for color customization it's advisable to change materials on a Skinned Mesh component of an object.

All characters are fully rigged and supports animation. Rig doesn't support animations from Mixamo. At least, it wasn't tested yet.
Notice: despite rigging the facial expressions have no bone constraints yet.

Models have high polygon count (46K-72K) and do not support LODs. Use them carefully.
